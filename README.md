In March 2022, I successfully completed my 8 weeksâ€™ Web Development course with Code First Girls.

The topics covered during my course were as follows:
HTML and CSS
JavaScript (data types, loops, conditionals, functions, objects and the DOM)
Github 101 & Frameworks
Project Presentation

As part of this course, I worked in a group of 3 to develop a responsive website using HTML, CSS & Javascript
